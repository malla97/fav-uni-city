# weather-app

A simple project to learn a little bit of typescript and flask. Also wanted to do a fullstack project as a test of skill.
It started as a boring weather-app, hence the name, but it might not have any weather data in it in the end. 

At the moment the goal is to make a website where the user can select their favourite city from given cities (cities with universities),
then the program will send the data to a database, and then on another compartment on the site some data will be displayed
about the users selections. Thats the rough idea atleast. Might add something, might change something, let's see how it shapes out.
