# fav-uni-city

At the moment the project is on ice, as im learning TypeScript from Scrimba. Will continue after that.

A simple project to learn a little bit of typescript and flask. Also wanted to do a fullstack project as a test of skill.
It started as a boring weather-app, but it might not have any weather data in it in the end. 

At the moment the goal is to make a website where the user can select their favourite city from given cities (cities with universities),
then the program will send the data to a database, and then on another compartment on the site some data will be displayed
about the users selections. I also want to make the site visually pleasing, but sometimes me and CSS don't quite see eye to eye on things.

But that's the rough idea atleast on the project. Might add something, might change something, let's see how it shapes out and hopefully I
have time to work on this from course projects.
